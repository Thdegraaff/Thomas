I am a spatial and urban economist employed at the department of Spatial
Economics of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My fields of professional
interests include international migration, teleworking, (spatial) econometrics,
transport economics, and most aspects of regional economics in general. 

Most recent research focusses on the impact and the use of (un)observed
heterogeneity, and I am rather interested in all sorts of non-parametric
econometrics and statistics as well. Basically, this site aims to give access to
my research, code snippets and workshops and to give additional information
about some of my work, thoughts and other musings.
