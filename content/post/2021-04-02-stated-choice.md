# What is this about? 

This is a more static and general post and deals with all sorts of materials
considering **stated choice experiments** to help master students in conducting
their analysis for their thesis. In the last year(s), we developed all sorts of
materials, especially in the form of knowledge clips, that may help students in
setting up the **design**, in their **estimations**, and in **interpreting**
their results. 

## Knowledge clips

Paul koster has made several clip on stated choice experiments

- [An introduction](https://video.vu.nl/media/Choice+experiments/1_ej62gyoc)
- [About designing in Excel](https://video.vu.nl/media/Statistical+design+of+choice+experiments+in+Excel/1_hksvwdnm)
- [About behavioural modelling](https://video.vu.nl/media/Behavioural+modelling+for+PACE/1_ya3kd12h)

Note that Paul Koster uses a different approach than usual as he allocates points to choices, which is applicable for studying different policies. The attractive feature of this is than one can uses just OLS instead of applying a logit (as typically in the case of discerning between two or more alternatives). 

I myself have made some clips this year. One is on an exam question (which is about the interpretation of the outcome and possible biases that may arise in Stated Preference surveys); the other deals with working with logistics regressions and why it is so different from ordinary least squares.

## Background material 

Paul Koster refers in his knowledge clip to the work of Sanko, Daly and Kroes (2002). 
You can find this paper [here](/docs/sanko.pdf).

## previous theses

Already many theses have been written using Stated preference techniques. Below
are some we do find of good quality and that also display the variation in topics. 
These theses should only be used for inspiration. Do not copy their methodological approach!

Theses:

- [Gerben de Jong (2014)](/docs/gerben_de_jong.pdf)
- [Lena Pax (2020)](/docs/lena_pax.pdf)
