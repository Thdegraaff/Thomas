# Stated choice experiments

This is a more static and general post and deals with all sorts of materials
considering **stated choice experiments** to help master students in conducting
their analysis for their thesis. In the last year(s), we developed all sorts of
materials, especially in the form of knowledge clips, that may help students in
setting up the **design**, in their **estimations**, and in **interpreting**
their results. 

## Knowledge clips

## Background material 

Paul Koster refers in his knowledge clip to the work of Sanko, Daly and Kroes (2002). 
You can find this paper [here](docs/sanko.pdf)

## previous theses

Already many theses have been written using Stated preference techniques. Below
are some we do find of good quality and that also display the variation in topics. 
These theses should only be used for inspiration. Do not copy their methodological approach!
