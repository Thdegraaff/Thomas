Our paper *Does new information technology change commuting behavior*
written together with Sergejs Gubins and Jos van Ommeren is accepted
in the **Annals of Regional Science**. It turned out to be nice paper
with an interesting main message: commuting in total did not change 
under the advent of ICT. Our identification is interesting, albeit that 
it hinges upon a very strong idenfitication assumption. Apart from ICT
trend in change of commuting do not differ amongst sector-job combinations.

The abstract reads as follows:

>We estimate the long-run causal effect of information technology,
>i.e., Internet and powerful computers, as measured by the adoption of
>teleworking, on average commuting distance within professions in the
>Netherlands. We employ data for 2 years, 1996 when information
>technology was hardly adopted and 2010 when information technology
>was widely used in a wide range of professions. Variation in
>information technology adoption over time and between professions
>allows us to infer the causal effect of interest using
>difference-in-differences techniques combined with propensity score
>matching. Our results show that the long-run causal effect of
>information technology on commuting distance is too small to be
>identified and likely to be absent. This suggests that, contrary to
>some assertions, the advent of information technology did not have a
>profound impact on the spatial structure of the labor market.
