Our paper *Valuation of Ethnic Diversity: Heterogeneous Effects in an Integrated
Labor and Housing Market* written together with Jessie Bakens is accepted in the
**Journal of Economic Geopraphy**. Jessie and I worked quite hard on this and I
am glad that we got the results. The abstract reads as follows:

  > We estimate the heterogeneous impact of the scale, composition and consumer
  good-effect of ethnic diversity on individuals' job and residential location.
  Using an extensive pooled micro panel-data set in which homeowners in the
  Netherlands are identified in both the housing and labor market we can derive
  the combined effect of ethnic diversity in both markets. We test a model that
  integrates the utility and production function such that the location of work
  and residence are determined simultaneously by taking into account observed and
  unobserved heterogeneous individual behavior on both markets. We find that the
  scale of ethnic diversity, i.e., the share of immigrants, at the city level is
  mostly positively related to both wages and house prices. This is mainly through
  a positive productivity effect of immigrants, which results in negative implicit
  prices for housing (although small) in a city with a higher scale of ethnic
  diversity for the majority of the individuals in our data. The scale of ethnic
  diversity is only positively related to utility for a small group of homeowners,
  while the composition (diversity among immigrants) and consumer good-effect
  (ethnic diversity of restaurants) of ethnic diversity show overall no
  significant effect on both markets nor significant implicit prices. Moreover, we
  find that the majority of Dutch homeowners do not sort themselves out over
    municipalities by their preferences for ethnic diversity.
