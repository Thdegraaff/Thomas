### Abstract

>Along with the increasing pace of globalization, recent decades faced
>a dramatically increase in international migrant flows as
>well. Compared to the flows of trade, capital and knowledge, we
>observe that contemporaneous complex institutional differences,
>historical backgrounds, and individuals' diverse socio-demographic
>characteristics make the migrant workers' choice of destination
>arguably much more uncontrollable. This study shows that migration is
>in a complex way intertwined with culture, networks and language, (i)
>by reviewing related studies on the barriers of culture, networks and
>language in international labor mobility, and (ii) by exploring
>missing gaps and prospective avenues for research. Nowadays, the
>migration pressure on Europe and the United states has created
>substantial challenges, leading to an urgent need to address the
>economic assimilation and social integration of migrants. Against
>this background, we emphasize that these non-economic factors have
>played an increasingly critical role in shaping international
>migration and its future socio-economic consequences for destination
>countries.
