I have a new publication in the **Annals of Regional Science**, titled: _On the_
_estimation of spatial stochastic frontier models: an alternative skew-normal_
_approach_. It is actually part of a special issue with guest editors Rachel
Guillain and Julie Le Gallo.

The full publication can be found here: [publication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-019-00928-9?wt%5Fmc=Internal.Event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorAssignedToIssue&utm%5Fsource=ArticleAuthorAssignedToIssue&utm%5Fmedium=email&utm%5Fcontent=AA%5Fen%5F06082018&ArticleAuthorAssignedToIssue%5F20200328)
