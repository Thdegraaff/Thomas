<h3 id="in-new-regional-economic-policies-national-and-regional-agendas-are-aligned-and-reinforce-each-other">In new regional economic policies, national and regional agendas are aligned and reinforce each other.</h3>
<p>The agendas are based on a joint strategy that
combines policy areas; policies aimed at strengthening
the economic structure also encompass plans of action
for human capital, the residential environment, the
physical environment and infrastructures.</p>
<h3 id="government-authorities-can-make-a-difference-to-regional-economic-growth">Government authorities can make a difference to regional economic growth.</h3>
<p>In economically successful regions, government authorities play an active role by
facilitating growth processes and investing in them.
The role of regional authorities to formulate a joint
strategy (all involved are of like mind) and to develop
alliances between public and private parties and with
national and provincial authorities. This is done by
streamlining generic policies towards regional tasks.
In successful regions, policies focus on factors that are
critical for growth and innovation, and on creating
places that are attractive to live and work in. This usually
involves establishing a coherent mix of policy areas, for
example by coordinating programmes for clusters,
entrepreneurship, the labour market, knowledge,
accessibility and the physical and residential
environments.</p>
<h3 id="there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-uniform-path-to-economic-success">There is no such thing as a uniform path to economic success.</h3>
<p>Regional economic developments vary widely
and are context-specific. Moreover, economic growth is
path-dependent; historical structures and past events
determine the course of subsequent developments.
The challenge is to find a suitable policy mix around a
common goal that is in line with the economic structure
and dynamism of the region. The core concept is
innovation and diversification, building on existing
structures. Regional economic policies therefore
combine present-day strengths, but also focus on the
transformation to new activities and technologies.</p>
<h3 id="there-are-however-robust-factors-that-stimulate-economic-growth-or-conversely-obstruct-it">There are, however, robust factors that stimulate economic growth, or, conversely, obstruct it.</h3>
<p>It proves
beneficial to focus policies on a number of robust
factors that are positively or negatively linked to growth
in both employment and productivity. The quantitative
analyses in this study show that economic growth is
stimulated by factors such as human capital (a very
qualified labour force), attractive conditions for living and
working with an interesting range of facilities (quality of
education, and numerous cultural amenities and
restaurants), and good accessibility in both physical and
digital terms. Growth is hampered by a high cost of living,
polluted air and noise pollution.</p>
<h3 id="growth-is-often-sector-specific">Growth is often sector-specific.</h3>
<p>What works fine for
one sector does not necessarily work for another. For
example, clustering and specialisation in technology and
materials are important for growth in industrial
companies, whereas the growth in knowledge-intensive
services is mainly linked to the quality of human capital.</p>
<h3 id="growth-is-often-context-specific">Growth is often context-specific.</h3>
<p>In regions with high
population density, the impact of knowledge and culture on
economic growth is particularly strong. Density brings
agglomeration benefits and is in itself robustly linked to
growth, but in combination with knowledge and culture,
its effect is reinforced. The impact of density is also
more marked in cities with good international connectivity.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-a-matter-of-having-a-policy-mix-aimed-at-a-total-innovation-system">It is a matter of having a policy mix aimed at a total innovation system.</h3>
<p>The qualitative analyses in this study reveal that in economically successful cities,
government authorities have made express efforts to
anticipate, facilitate and invest. In these places, there
has been a shift in recent decades from policies with a
physical orientation, focusing on spatial planning and
infrastructure, to policies aimed at establishing an
overall innovation system. Programmes for
entrepreneurship, clusters, knowledge and innovation
have become important elements of a policy mix whose
specific details are worked out according to the regional
context. Thanks to this policy mix, regional authorities
have contributed to ensuring that economic renewal could
take place in a bottom-up process in a timely fashion.
They achieved this by creating critical mass around the
new and promising economic activities that were
emerging in the region. But, they also stimulated
innovation in sectors that had a strong presence in the
region and were in danger of entering a phase of
decline.</p>
<h3 id="backing-challengers-is-a-priority-in-policy">Backing challengers is a priority in policy.</h3>
<p>Policies are
not aimed at ‘picking winners’, an approach that
involves opting for certain sectors. Nor are they aimed at
‘backing losers’, in efforts to maintain sectors that are
performing badly. They are best characterised as
‘backing challengers’; they stimulate both innovation
within the existing structure and the challengers of the
established order. By making this concrete in the form
of a policy mix, promising new activities, which are in
line with the economic activities, technologies, themes
or challenges in the region, are able to prosper.</p>
<h3 id="policies-make-choices">Policies make choices.</h3>
<p>While urban planning aimed at
creating attractive cities with a high quality of life can
be beneficial to entire populations and all businesses,
its actual interpretation is often specific to a region or
city. Policies in successful cities focus strongly on
certain economic objectives or target groups. In
practice, this can involve, for example, creating
attractive residential conditions and facilities for
knowledge workers, or creating working conditions for
specific new economic activities that are in line with the
knowledge and innovation policy. Key issues here are
the desired economic structure and geographic location
in relation to other cities.</p>
<h3 id="institutions-are-strong-and-follow-trends">Institutions are strong and follow trends.</h3>
<p>In economically successful regions, the institutions are
structured under public-private, multi-level (national,
regional and local) and cross-sectoral cooperation.
Institutions are proactive and able to adapt, allowing
modification by government authorities to suit
changing circumstances, anticipation on future
problems and the search for new opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="growth-can-be-based-on-unplanned-events">Growth can be based on unplanned events.</h3>
<p>Many
growth processes are therefore path-dependent. In the
initial phase, when it is not clear whether growth will
actually take place, steering the process is a far more
uncertain exercise than facilitating and promoting
innovation from existing growth paths.</p>
<h3 id="both-the-national-and-the-regional-level">Both the national and the regional level.</h3>
<p>National
governments can also play an important role in regional
economic developments. National policies have effects
at the regional level and, if they are customised, they
could effectively fit in with regional contexts and
regional policy initiatives. In addition, there are several
matters that can be dealt with more readily by national
authorities than by regional authorities. Examples
include safeguarding national or supra-regional
interests, operating above the level of the regional
lobby, and providing a knowledge and monitoring
system to analyse and assess economic developments.</p>
<p>These findings follow from quantitative and qualitative
research into the question of which policies are effective
when aiming to support the potential for urban and
regional growth. They provide policymakers with insight
into issues that are important for economic growth and
into how policy efforts can contribute to economic
growth. This report presents a menu, so to speak, of policy
options.</p>
